# SQL
This repository houses files that I have created using MySQL through Analyst Builder projects that started with introducatory concepts and led to advanced functions.

The CSV files 'WorldLifeExpecancy', 'USHouseholdIncome' and 'USHouseholdIncome_Statistics'  were availible through the course resources.

The SQL file 'Life_ExpectacyGH'  was an introductory exploratory analysis.

The SQL file 'income_cleanGH' was an advanced exercise that created an automated cleaning schedule.
